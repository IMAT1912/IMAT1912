# Lab exercises

In this series of lab exercises, we will build some very simple python applications.
The aim is not to deliver exhaustive coverage of the python ecosystem but to become familiar with python idioms and best practices by developing simple user interfaces for simple projects.
We will be developing very simple projects into high quality code.

The majority of your learning should take place outside of lab sessions where you are expected to experiment and practice to develop your understanding and experience with the language.
You are expected to practice between each session and to do your own research, going beyond the lab materials.
Ideally, looking for good questions to ask in the next session.

You are expected to become familiar with the python documentation.
Links are included to the appropriate parts of the documentation where possible.
Please follow them as necessary to get used to how the python documentation is written.

> Please do mention if there are missing links, I can easily add them in.

Most importantly, use the lab sessions to ask any questions you have.
Asking a good question will help to clarify your understanding and will help everyone in the room to confirm or challenge their understanding.

>I will answer your questions to the best of my ability in the lab sessions.
If you stump me (very likely), we can research the answer asynchronously and compare notes in the next session.


# lab-01 - lists and strings

Working with **lists** and **strings** are essential python skills. 
In the first lab session we will create a simple *shopping list*.
The **list** will contain **strings** representing the items.

```python
shopping = [
    "apples", 
    "bananas",
]
todo.append("clementines")
```

We introduce some control flow and play with a few common patterns for list and string manipulation.
